# Used Cars Price Prediction

## OVERVIEW
The business of selling used cars is quite popular and dealers need to decide an optimum price at which they should buy used cars so that they gain a decent profit. Thus, predicting the price of used cars becomes important. This model is built to predict the price of used cars in INR based on various factors like Body Type, Mileage, Power, Torque, Number of Past Owners, etc. 

This can be useful for car dealers to predict cars based on it specifications and decide which cars to buy based on the potential profit they can earn.

## TECHNICAL ASPECTS

The model is based on multiple linear regression algorithm. 
The following libraries have been used in this project-
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. Scikit-learn
